## Problem

[Pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) the *Occupation* column in **OCCUPATIONS** so that each *Name* is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding *Occupation*. The output should consist of four columns (*Doctor*, *Professor*, *Singer*, and *Actor*) in that specific order, with their respective names listed alphabetically under each column.

**Note:** Print **NULL** when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.


**Input Format**

The **OCCUPATIONS** table is described as follows:

*Occupation* will only contain one of the following values: **Doctor**, **Professor**, **Singer** or **Actor**.

**Constraints**

            ORDER BY Name
        ) AS rn
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
)
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Doctor' THEN Name END) AS Doctor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Professor' THEN Name END) AS Professor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Singer' THEN Name END) AS Singer,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Actor' THEN Name END) AS Actor
FROM Ranked
GROUP BY rn
ORDER BY rn;
