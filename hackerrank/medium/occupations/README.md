## Problem

[Pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) the *Occupation* column in **OCCUPATIONS** so that each *Name* is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding *Occupation*. The output should consist of four columns (*Doctor*, *Professor*, *Singer*, and *Actor*) in that specific order, with their respective names listed alphabetically under each column.

**Note:** Print **NULL** when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.


**Input Format**

The **OCCUPATIONS** table is described as follows:
